    <h1>Traditional German Warm Potato Salad</h1>
    <img class="desc-image" src="../images/potato-salad.webp" alt="Potato salad img">
    <p>Is there anything better than freshly made potato salad? With sausages or pork, it's a dream! This recipe is from
        Bavaria, Germany, and my family makes this potato salad every year for Christmas eve.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ¼ pounds waxy potatoes</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup hot vegetable broth</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and
            simmer until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Drain. Cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Peel while still
            warm. Cut into thin slices and put in a large bowl. Add onion.</li>
        <li>Mix hot broth with vinegar, oil, salt, and sugar. Pour immediately over warm potatoes and onion; the
            potatoes need to still be warm so they can absorb the dressing better. Allow to stand for 5 minutes; season
            with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
